The name is inspired by the mighty executable textbook volumes known as Software Foundations.

Idk how much time I'll be putting into this. I'm just figuring out what abstractions and libraries I want to use.

## Package: `game-theory`

- Goal: a `coq` library for game theory.
- Goal: annotate it to be a textbook and add exercises.

## Package: `nashwires`

- Goal: a graphical proof assistant for open games.

## Package: `comms`

- Goal: communicate about this project; blogs, talks, papers.

## Package: `soupault`

- https://game-theory-foundations.netlify.app
- contains `alectryon`ification of `game-theory` package.
