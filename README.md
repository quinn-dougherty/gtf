The name is inspired by the mighty executable textbook volumes known as Software Foundations.

Idk how much time I'll be putting into this. I'm just figuring out what abstractions and libraries I want to use.

## Package: `game-theory`

- Goal: a `coq` library for game theory.
- Goal: annotate it to be a textbook and add exercises.

## Package: `nashwires`

- Goal: a graphical proof assistant for open games.
- Goal: react code for wiring/string diagram editing.

## Package: `comms`

- Goal: communicate about this project; blogs, talks, papers.

## Package: `soupault`

- Goal: present this work with the `soupault` static site generator.
